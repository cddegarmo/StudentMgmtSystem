##### About
This repository shares some characteristics with the *emailapp* project. Mainly it's an exercise in processing data about students in
a university's database, like courses enrolled and tuition paid. It combines general OOP principles with a fair amount of I/O to generate
an output report of all students enrolled and their tuition balances.

The main method can be found in **src/user/MainApplication.java**.
